## General info
This project main objective was to create a CRUD application that utilises the tools and technologies learnt througout my QA training. My overall motivation for this project was based on my love of the gym. I wanted an app where I was able to manage my workouts on a daily bases.

### Architecture 
### Database structure
The Image below shows an Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) with a many-to-many relationship between workouts and exercises. This means the the user can create workouts and add many exercises to the database with only one workout type. When observing this the other way, many workouts can be associated with one exercise. The diagram shows everything that has been implemented into my SQL database.
